# delta_hedging_MSCI_world
This is a project I made with a classmate. In the first part, we analyzed 10 pairs of European options to see if they provided arbitrage opportunities and applied the Black-Scholes model to compute the deltas. In the second part, we developed a delta hedging strategy for changes in asset prices and exchange rates affecting the MSCI World Index.
