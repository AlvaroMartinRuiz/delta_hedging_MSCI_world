# delta_hedging_MSCI_world
This is a project I completed with a classmate. In the first part, we analyzed 10 pairs of European options to identify arbitrage opportunities and applied the Black-Scholes model to compute the deltas. In the second part, we developed a delta hedging strategy for managing changes in asset prices and exchange rates affecting the MSCI World Index.

## 1.	Part 1: Analyzing 10 pairs of European options:
o We selected 10 European options from the Eurex platform and analyzed their prices, focusing on the theoretical boundaries for call and put option prices. We also examined whether these options provided arbitrage opportunities.
o	We adjusted for dividends when necessary and explored whether the prices followed put-call parity, calculating risk-free interest rates and maximum dividend levels required for the boundaries to hold.
o	Additionally, we applied the Black-Scholes model to check the theoretical pricing of options and analyzed the delta sensitivity of option prices to changes in the underlying asset price.

## 2.	Part 2: Hedging strategies for investment funds:
o	The second part investigates how a large investment fund, using the MSCI World Index, can hedge against risks related to falling asset prices and foreign exchange rates.
o	The study includes the acquisition of asset data, hedging foreign exchange risks through options, and creating a delta-neutral portfolio to mitigate small variations in asset prices.
o	We also explained how to hedge against asset price drops using futures contracts and discussed the pros and cons of using options and futures for hedging strategies.
